## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **Pre-configured Apollo Client:** The project comes with a preconfigured setup for Apollo Client
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/datamodel.graphql) – easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup


## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `vue-fullstack-minimal` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate vue-fullstack-minimal

# 2. When prompted, deploy the Prisma service to a _public cluster_

# 3. Navigate into the `server` directory of the new project
cd my-app/server

# 4. Start the server
yarn dev # runs server on http://localhost:4000, and opens GraphQL PLayground

# 5. Open a new tab in the terminal and navigate back into my-app;
# then run the app
cd ..
yarn start
```
